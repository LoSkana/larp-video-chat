# larp-video-chat

Do you want to easily deploy a video chat system in your LARP? And to costumize it too? Take a look here!

# What is it? 

Imagine a skype you can use anywhere & anytime in your LARP, without having to worry about internet connection or call quality!
And you can personalize it as well!

# How does it work? 

Based on the WebRTC standard (https://webrtc.org/) and the RTCMultiConnection implementation (https://github.com/muaz-khan/RTCMultiConnection).

# It is true? 

Just try it yourself: you just need two pcs, two webcams, one router and 15 minutes to spare: follow the instructions on INSTALL.

# You said something about customization? 

Take a look at index.html: it's a barebone web page. You can add images, text, style in any way you want, for example if you want to achieve a militaristic or a scifi look, based on the theme of your LARP!

Just don't remove elements with an id, though ;)
